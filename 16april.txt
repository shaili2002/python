Q1. Explain call by value and call by reference.

Ans. a) Call by value: You give a function a copy of a variable's value,so changes inside the functiondon't affect the original variable outside the function. It's like sharing a photo of a cake with a friend,so whatever they do with their photo doesn't change your cake.

b) Call by reference: You give a function the actual variable itself,so changes inside the function affect the original variable outside the function. It's like sharing the actual cake with a friend,so any changes they make to the cake directly affect the one you have.

Q2. Difference between Python2 and Pyhton3.

Ans. 1) Print Statement: In Python 2, the print statement is used without parentheses, like print "Hello". 
                         In Python 3, it's a function and requires parentheses, like print("Hello").
     2) Integer Division: In Python 2, if you divide two integers, you get an integer result, like 5 / 2 = 2                                
                          In Python 3, division always returns a float, like 5 / 2 = 2.5
     3) Integer size: In Python 2, limited to 32 bits.
                      In Python 3, Unlimited.
     4) Leak of variables: In Python 2, never changes.
                           In Python 3, changes while using it inside for loop.
