Q2. What is a life scope of a variable?

Ans. The "life scope" of a variable typically refers to the portion of a program where that variable is accessible and holds a value. This concept   
     is closely related to the scope of a variable, which defines where in the code that variable can be referenced.

There are generally three main types of variable scope:-
 
a) Global Scope: Variables defined outside of any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code, including 
                 within functions.
b) Local Scope: Variables defined within a function or a block (such as an if statement or loop) have local scope. They are only accessible within  
                that function or block.
c) Function Scope: In some languages, variables declared within a function have scope limited to that function. They cannot be accessed outside of 
                   that function.
